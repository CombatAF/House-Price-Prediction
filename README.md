# House-Price-Prediction
Uses various modern parameters to detect house price in urban areas

House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project predicts the prices of houses based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. The model uses machine learning techniques to estimate house prices accurately based on the dataset.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and standardizes numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifies trends and relationships between variables through visualizations and statistical analysis.
Model Training and Testing:
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trains a regression model to predict house prices.
Model Evaluation: Includes metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.
Prediction System: Implements a system to predict house prices based on custom input data.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
numpy for numerical computations.
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Dataset
The dataset used contains information about houses, such as:

Number of Bedrooms
Number of Bathrooms
Total Square Footage
Location (encoded as categorical features)
Year Built
Sale Price (Target Variable)
You can use publicly available datasets like the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Usage
Load Dataset: The script reads house_prices.csv (or your chosen dataset).
Preprocess Data: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Train Model: Trains a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest).
Evaluate Model: Tests the model using metrics like MAE and R-squared.
Make Predictions: Use input_data to test with custom house features.
Results
Training R-squared: ~0.85
Test R-squared: ~0.82
Example
Input Example:

python
Copy code
input_data = {'bedrooms': 3, 'bathrooms': 2, 'sqft_living': 2000, 'location': 'Suburb', 'year_built': 2010}
Run the predictive system:

bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Output:

swift
Copy code
The predicted house price is $350,000.
Future Improvements
Include advanced regression techniques like XGBoost or LightGBM.
Add more features such as proximity to schools, public transport, or crime rates.
Integrate a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for user-friendly predictions.
